What is company culture?
Company culture is how you do what you do in the workplace. It’s the sum of your formal and informal systems and behaviors and values, all of which create an experience for your employees and customers.
At its core, company culture is how things get done around the workplace. “How” includes both the formal systems, and the informal behaviors.

For example, your company may use instant messaging software to communicate throughout the day (system), and it may also be okay to yell at a coworker to get your point across (behavior). Your systems and behaviors give employees the “rules of the road” for interacting with the business, and each other.

Company culture is often something you can feel, even as an outsider.

I can recall the first time I walked into the lobby of a company on our Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® list. As I approached the door, employees who were walking in and passing by made eye contact and said “hello.”

The employee behind the desk greeted me warmly, offering me a cup of coffee and a comfortable seat. There was a distinct, positive energy in the building. My first experiences as a guest gave me a taste of how they “do things around here.”

How to identify your company culture
The best way to understand a company’s culture is to ask employees. This could be through an employee experience survey platform like Emprising™.

You’ll hear some people describe a company culture with statements like “people are willing to talk to each other, share what they know and take the proactive step to get you in touch with the right person,” or “people always come first”.

Cool perks like unlimited vacation time and innovative policies may help shape company culture, but they do not make a great workplace. The experience of your people does.

Where does organizational culture come from?
Of all the ingredients that make up your organizational culture, the most important variables are how:

Employees communicate with each other
Decisions are made
People are hired, promoted, and let go
Employees are recognized
Employees celebrate their work and each other
Every company does each of these things, but as in most things, it’s not what you do, it’s how you do it.

Why is company culture important?
Company culture is important because it directly affects company performance on key metrics including finances, employee retention, innovation and customer service. 

1. Financial returns

According to research by Great Place to Work and FTSE Russell, annual returns for the 100 Best Companies have had a cumulative return of 1,709% since 1998, as compared to a 526% return for the Russell 3000 Index during the same period.

2. Employee retention

When a workforce is diverse and the company culture is inclusive, equitable and rewarding for all employees, people are willing to stay at the company a long time. Millennials, for example, are 11 times more likely to leave their company than Gen Xers if their needs for purpose at work are not met.

3. Innovation

When employees experience inclusive leadership behaviors and systems, they are better poised to speak up, share ideas and adapt to change. This is what we call a culture of innovation or Innovation by All™. 

4. Customer service

Studies confirm that employee happiness translates into employee efficiency, creativity and productivity. This, in turn, has the same effect on customers.

In our own research on the average U.S. workforce and how they compare to Great Place to Work-Certified™ companies (companies where employees rank the company culture highly), we found that employees at Certified workplaces are 34% more likely to rate their customer service as “excellent.”


4 keys to building an effective company culture
1. Start where you are

Whether you have five employees or 50, there’s no better place to start than where you are. Initiate conversations with your employees about what makes your workplace distinct.

They’ll give you the language around what makes your culture tick. For marketing agency Brains On Fire, these initial conversations formed the basis of their company values.

2. Define the boundaries

Effective company culture doesn’t happen by accident, so once you have a pretty good understanding of what’s working in your workplace, apply your aspirational vision.

What is the experience you want to your employees to have? What do you want customers to say about your company? What behavior is inbounds and what is out-of-bounds?

Based on employee feedback, Brains On Fire created a series of “golden rules,” or team values to encapsulate their principles and guide employee behaviors, such as “clear is kind” and “de-escalate versus escalate.”

3. Model the way

This is where leaders must step up to move beyond words into action. Your mission, vision and values often reside on the wall, but the company culture is HOW you achieve those ends.

If integrity is a core value, make sure everyone knows what it means to ACT with integrity. If transparency is a core value, make sure you demonstrate WHAT transparency looks like.

And remember, you’re either building, breaking or rebuilding trust in every interaction with employees, so make your early ones count. 

4. Measure your progress

Even our best intentions may fall short of producing the desired employee experience, so make sure you’re getting regular feedback.

Your people want to share their thoughts and recommendations for change, and the more you ask them, the more they’ll offer their best thinking to help continuously improve your business. Monitoring and analyzing employee feedback trends via an employee survey platform like Emprising will help guide your strategic HR decisions.

Assess and transform your company culture
Change involves introspection, so, naturally, the best leaders put a lot of focus on reflection. If you want to analyze your company culture and measure your progress, reach out to us about our survey and assessment tools for transforming company culture.

Respect in the Workplace
08 Nov 2017 / Samantha Hill
Respect is the foundation of any positive and healthy workplace. It’s the support beam of every team, holding people up at eye-level with each other. Respect in the workplace is recognising that you, your employees and co-workers all have individual opinions, rights, values, beliefs, experience and competence.

Exercising respect doesn’t necessarily come naturally within a workplace – it’s a commitment that takes practice and teamwork to accomplish. Having the right HR policies in place, and openly communicating and planning approaches to issues, will encourage respect and make your employees feel fulfilled and motivated to perform their best.

Why is respect in the workplace important?
Workplace legislation has long been guided by respect, drawing awareness to discrimination, fair work policies and working conditions. Respect encourages new ideas and innovation by ensuring the entire team hears differing values, beliefs and opinions.

Respect allows your employees to feel valued in their roles. Valued employees feel recognised and motivated, meaning they’re ready to meet expectations and achieve more. It’s safe to say that respect is a vital part of any team.

A respectful workplace leads to:

Job satisfaction: respect culture allows for your employees to perform better, develop more and express creativity – all factors that contribute to job satisfaction.
Employee engagement: when your employees feel valued, they’re more likely to pitch in and work hard.
Less stress and conflict: the proper respect practices minimise stress for your staff, so they remain healthy and happy working with you.
Productivity: being productive is a given when you allow your team to keep up morale through a respectful workplace.
Positive relationships: your team will flourish with respect. The more you practice respect with your team, the easier it will be to get along.
What does respect in the workplace look like?
A respectful workplace is one that thrives on fairness, equality, and the inclusion of all staff. But respect is more than that – here are common qualities you will find in a respectful workplace:

Empathy and compassion
Interpersonal skills
Equality and fairness
Inclusivity
Courtesy and care
Trust and honesty.
How to create a respectful workplace
Harnessing respect is a powerful ingredient that links with high engagement, high satisfaction, productivity and knowledge-sharing. So how do we create an environment for our team to feel respected and valued?

Work on self-development
Don’t be afraid to set your staff up with a little homework. Workforce management software like Roubler can set you up with e-learning courses that will help your team grow and prosper. Work on self-development courses from your device and tailor what your team learn.

Listening and including
Employees who feel respected and included in their workplace have higher levels of engagement. Create a system where employees can share their thoughts and ideas on essential matters. You can delegate tasks for employees to oversee, making them feel valued as a part of the team.

Don’t assume the worst of anyone
Always listen to your employees, assess and work together to develop changes in behaviour where needed. Don’t assume that your employees intend to do wrong by the company for their benefit – perhaps they misunderstood.

When you’re wrong, apologise
We all make mistakes – when it happens, we apologise – being a great leader is knowing when to admit you’re wrong and move forward with a positive outlook. If we can’t hold ourselves accountable for our mishaps, our staff will feel undervalued.

Putting construction into your criticism
Constructive criticism is motivating and reassuring towards the growth and development of your employees. Don’t tell them what they did wrong, but how they can do it better.

Building self-esteem
A workplace that builds self-esteem holds high respect for their staff. Set your employees up for success by helping them work on weaknesses and by celebrating their improvements. Listen to their concerns and treat them like the high performers you know they can become.

Recognising and rewarding
A respectful, positive workplace is one that continues recognising staff wins. Whether in the form of prizes or shout outs at team meetings, make sure you are acknowledging your employees for all the hard work they are putting in.

When it comes to respect in the workplace, good quality practices can push your staff to feel comfortable, valued and positive about going to work each day. Work on being inclusive, listen to your team, recognise them and your workplace will thrive.
