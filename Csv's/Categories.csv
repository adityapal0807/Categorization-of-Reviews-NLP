The over time opportunities at Amazon are a plus if you want to earn some extra money and there's always work available for you to do. Amazon also offers a good competition and spirit during peak time. Overall, compared to most other companies, the employee satisfaction factor is best at Amazon India. I'm quite content with my role and especially how employees at Amazon behave with each other. They're always polite and ready to assist. There's not a single time I've met or talked to someone who felt like they ain't a good fit. I guess Amazon instills this as soon as one joins the company. 'It's always day one at Amazon.' That's what we believe here and this is the exact reason why we're always encouraged to grow and learn without being judged for not knowing stuff.
